This dataset contains three data files (.csv) and three code files (.qmd) used to generate results and figures for the manuscript 
"Sex steroid profiles align with phenotype in sex-reversed female lizards". The three code files are as follows:

- Reproductivemodels.qmd contains the model used to contrast reproductive ZZ and ZW females in T and E2 concentrations over inferred reproductive state. It requires the datafile Reproductivefemale_model1_data.csv

- Nonreproductivemodel.qmd contains the model used to contrast ZZ males and females, and ZW females in T and E2 concentrations over three timepoints during a breeding season. It requires the datafile Final_AdultHormone_DataSheet.csv

- YolkDataExploration2024 contains various code used to look at relationships between T and E2 in egg yolks from ZZ and ZW females, as well as comparisons of maternal and yolk hormone measurements. It requires both the yolkresultsv3.csv and Final_AdultHormone_DataSheet.csv datafiles. 

Raw data outputs etc. can be made available on request.
